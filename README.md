**RestoDash** is a fully digitized, real-time localized point-of-sale (POS) and operational management system specifically tailored for fast-paced modern restaurants. Built entirely with React and powered by a live PostgreSQL database via Supabase, RestoDash provides instantly synchronized state between front-of-house Waiters, back-of-house Kitchen Display Systems (KDS), and Administration hubs.

## ✨ Core Features & Platform Modules

RestoDash operates on a highly integrated role-based system, separating application logic into three distinct but deeply synchronized portals:

### 📱 1. Waiter Portal (Front-of-House)
The Waiter Portal features an interactive **Floor Plan Manager** to command tables dynamically.
- **Smart Cart Integration**: Instantly pull up table logs to create multi-item orders complete with custom preparation notes (e.g., *"Less Spicy"*).
- **Grace Period Buffers**: Features an innovative built-in "Buffer Window" when "Sending to Kitchen", allowing last-minute customer edits and cancellations without wasting kitchen prep resources. 
- **Live Handoff Mechanics**: Watch cooking timers visually count down live. Receive an amber warning pulse when orders are nearly done, and explicitly confirm serving delivery.

### 👨‍🍳 2. Kitchen Display System (KDS)
The KDS drastically streamlines the back-of-house operation by intelligently sorting order queues.
- **Strict Progression States**: Tickets natively render as greyed out whilst Waiters are actively building or editing carts during their Grace Time.
- **Chef Time Prompts**: Intercept starting orders with an interactive manual pop-up asking the cooking line an exact estimate for their Prep Time (MM:SS), triggering a synchronized digital countdown across all associated tablets natively.
- **Inter-system Pager**: Broadcast instant typed messages straight back out to active Waiter panels from the prep station.

### 📊 3. Admin Console (Point-Of-Sale)
The Admin hub serves as the control center where completed orders queue up flawlessly for final checkout processing.
- **Automated E-Billing**: Generates professional, fully itemized PDF Receipts natively utilizing `jsPDF` completely in-memory upon confirmation.
- **Digital Email Invoicing**: Connects to the `EmailJS` backend to scrape active checkout orders, converting them instantly into a premium HTML Email Invoice dispatched flawlessly to the dine-in customer's digital pockets, saving receipt paper and generating brand presence.
- **Takeaway Integrations**: Seamlessly handles walk-ins and external integrations by spoofing rapid pseudo-tables in the background to sustain schema rules.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TailwindCSS 4, React Router v7
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL Realtime Subscriptions)
- **Document Rendering**: jsPDF & jsPDF-AutoTable
- **Comms Interface**: EmailJS (v4.4 SDK)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Packaging**: Vite bundler deployed efficiently to GH Pages

## 📐 Order Lifecycle Architecture

RestoDash uses a rigorous status mapping state machine:

1. **`buffer`** - 10-Second grace window protecting against misclicks. Edit/Cancel completely accessible. 
2. **`pending`** - Officially locked into the KDS queue waiting for Chef acceptance.
3. **`cooking`** - Actively prepping. Emits live MM:SS countdowns across all WebSockets. Waiters locked to read-only views.
4. **`ready`** - Chef marks plate ready. Appears as a high-visibility CTA to Waiters.
5. **`served`** - Waiter confirms physical delivery. Table goes to 'Eating' or 'Paying' state, sliding bill down to Admin queue.
6. **`paid`** - Invoice remitted via E-Mail. Table aggressively scrubbed, dropping completely off the memory stack!

## 🛠️ Setting up Locally

1. Clone the repository and run standard installations:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate a `.env` file containing your valid Supabase project details to sustain internal hooks:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://[YOUR_KEY].supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR_JWT]
   ```
   *Note: Database architecture assumes `orders`, `tables`, and `messages` tables are strictly mapped and subscribe-ready.*

3. Spin up the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
